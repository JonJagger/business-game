The XY Business Game

The XY Business Game is a fun simulation that models technology evolution.
It offers players (both individuals and teams) a chance to see how they tend
to respond to risk and reward.
In the simulation two organizations compete against each other in a series of rapid decision rounds,
with each org's earnings based on their decisions.
During the game an org may ask to purchase XY consulting
advice (using some of their earnings).
The session will consist of playing the game, followed by a retrospective.
It is based on a simulation originally devised by Jerry Weinberg.
The evening game will be run by Jon Jagger and Mike Long.
Needs a minimum of 8 participants, ideally 16 or more.
1 laptop with an internet connection is required for each Org.
